# Project Euler solutions

These are solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems. I
add to them when I have insomnia or otherwise need to take my mind off things.
Solutions are implemented in Python or, in cases where Python does not perform
well, Chicken Scheme. 

## Disclaimer

I'm not a formally trained programmer, so these algorithms tend to rely on
brute-forcing the answer. If it's elegance you seek, seek elsewhere.
